# StockMarket-Prediction-
This project focuses on predicting future stock market values using machine learning techniques. It leverages Python Flask for web development, scikit-learn (sklearn) and Keras for model building, and Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.The project was develop by my team Ahad Mulani,Aneesh Koprade , and Rohit kharat.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Utilizes Jupyter notebooks for exploring and visualizing stock market data.
- **Model Building:** Implements predictive models using scikit-learn and Keras.
- **Web Interface:** Provides a Flask-based web interface for users to interact with the model and view predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for building the web interface.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn):** Used for implementing traditional machine learning algorithms.
- **Keras:** Used for building and training deep learning models.
- **Jupyter:** For creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
